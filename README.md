Dear Alma

  This notes is coming with kolak that was delivered earlier in the form of barcode
  that was printed in a card inside with hope of deliver a bold, new and exciting experience 🤩
  padahal yang dikirim cuman kolak HAHAHAHAH.

  it took about 4 trial of experience and 3 months of work, and 40km of driving
  untill kolaknya finally jadi and delivered to you .

  dont forget 2 wash ur hands w/ soap or hand sanitizer that was included in the bag 🧼
  dont forget to pray and read basmallah before grab a bite .
