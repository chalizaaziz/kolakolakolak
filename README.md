Dear Alma

  This note is coming with kolak that was delivered earlier in the form of barcode
  that was printed in a card inside with hope of providing a bold, new and exciting experience 🤩
  padahal yang dikirim cuman kolak HAHAHAHAH 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

  it took about 4 trial of experiments and 3 months of work 😔👉🏻👈🏻, and 40km of driving
  untill kolaknya finally jadi and delivered to you.

  dont forget 2 wash ur hands w/ soap or hand sanitizer that was included in the bag 🧼
  dont forget to pray and read basmallah before grabbing a bitee ! (sekadar mengingatkan 🙏🏻)
  
  ud gitu aja, here i present you, **kolak ter ena seduniya fana!** **#nodebat** btw monmaap niii 3 bulan bru jadi 🥺
